# Nova UI Akira - Page Templates

This directory contains the custom page templates available in the Nova UI Akira WordPress theme.

## Available Templates

### Default Template
The default template (customized in `page.php`) is completely blank without header, footer, or sidebar - except for a minimal footer that says "Potenciado por NovaLabss" with a link to NovaLabss.com. The footer adapts to the page's color scheme.

### Canvas
The Canvas template (`template-canvas.php`) is an entirely empty template without any elements - no header, no footer, no sidebar, not even a container. It's designed for maximum flexibility when you need absolute control over the page content.

### Dashboard
The Dashboard template (`template-dashboard.php`) is designed for admin-style interfaces with a fixed height content area, no footer, and a particular layout optimized for dashboards.

### Dashboard Overflow
The Dashboard Overflow template (`template-dashboard-overflow.php`) is similar to the Dashboard template but enables vertical scrolling. It's useful when your dashboard content needs to be longer than the viewport.

## How to Use
